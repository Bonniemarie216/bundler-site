<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3 id="heroku-errors">Heroku errors</h3>

<p>Please open a ticket with <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> if you’re having trouble deploying. They have a professional support team who can help you resolve Heroku issues far better than the Bundler team can. If the problem that you are having turns out to be a bug in Bundler itself, <a href="https://www.heroku.com/support">Heroku support</a> can get the exact details to us.</p>

<h3 id="other-problems">Other problems</h3>

<p>First, figure out exactly what it is that you’re trying to do (see <a href="http://xyproblem.info/">XY Problem</a>). Then, go to the <a href="http://bundler.io">Bundler documentation website</a> and see if we have instructions on how to do that.</p>

<p>Second, check <a href="http://bundler.io/compatibility.html">the compatibility
list</a>, and make sure that the version of Bundler that you are
using works with the versions of Ruby and Rubygems that you are using. To see your versions:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># Bundler version
bundle -v

# Ruby version
ruby -v

# Rubygems version
gem -v
</code></pre>

<p>If these instructions don’t work, or you can’t find any appropriate instructions, you can try these troubleshooting steps:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># Remove user-specific gems and git repos
rm -rf ~/.bundle/ ~/.gem/bundler/ ~/.gems/cache/bundler/

# Remove system-wide git repos and git checkouts
rm -rf $GEM_HOME/bundler/ $GEM_HOME/cache/bundler/

# Remove project-specific settings
rm -rf .bundle/

# Remove project-specific cached gems and repos
rm -rf vendor/cache/

# Remove the saved resolve of the Gemfile
rm -rf Gemfile.lock

# Uninstall the rubygems-bundler and open_gem gems
rvm gemset use global # if using rvm
gem uninstall rubygems-bundler open_gem

# Try to install one more time
bundle install
</code></pre>

<h2 id="reporting-unresolved-problems">Reporting unresolved problems</h2>

<p>Hopefully the troubleshooting steps above resolved your problem. If things still aren’t working the way you expect them to, please let us know so that we can diagnose and hopefully fix the problem you’re having.</p>

<p><strong>The best way to report a bug is by providing a reproduction script.</strong> See these examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/xaviershay/6207550">Git environment variables causing install to fail.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/xaviershay/6295889">Multiple gems in a repository cannot be updated independently.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A half working script with comments for the parts you were unable to automate is still appreciated.</p>

<p>If you are unable to do that, please include the following information in your report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What you’re trying to accomplish</li>
  <li>The command you ran</li>
  <li>What you expected to happen</li>
  <li>What actually happened</li>
  <li>The exception backtrace(s), if any</li>
  <li>Everything output by running <code>bundle env</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If your version of Bundler does not have the <code>bundle env</code> command, then please include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <code>Gemfile</code></li>
  <li>Your <code>Gemfile.lock</code></li>
  <li>Your Bundler configuration settings (run <code>bundle config</code>)</li>
  <li>What version of bundler you are using (run <code>bundle -v</code>)</li>
  <li>What version of Ruby you are using (run <code>ruby -v</code>)</li>
  <li>What version of Rubygems you are using (run <code>gem -v</code>)</li>
  <li>Whether you are using RVM, and if so what version (run <code>rvm -v</code>)</li>
  <li>Whether you have the <code>rubygems-bundler</code> gem, which can break gem executables (run <code>gem list rubygems-bundler</code>)</li>
  <li>Whether you have the <code>open_gem</code> gem, which can cause rake activation conflicts (run <code>gem list open_gem</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using Rails 2.3, please also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <code>boot.rb</code> file</li>
  <li>Your <code>preinitializer.rb</code> file</li>
  <li>Your <code>environment.rb</code> file</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have either <code>rubygems-bundler</code> or <code>open_gem</code> installed, please try removing them and then following the troubleshooting steps above before opening a new ticket.</p>
